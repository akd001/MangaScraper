MangaScraper
============

Download manga chapters, pdf features coming!

The scraper has been built to work on Mangapanda, but can be tweaked to work on any website with similar urls. You will need beautifulsoup installed to get the code working [follow the link to install bs: http://bit.ly/installBeautifulSoup]

All you need to do is open any recent chapter of your favourite manga and look up its url [which looks something like this: http://www.mangapanda.com/naruto/700/20]. Enter the name of the manga as is written after mangapanda.com [naruto in this case] as the 'mangaName' and the last chapter in the range which you want to download as 'mangaChapter'. Enter the full system path of the folder you want your manga to be downloaded in to as 'saveMangaFolder'. The images will be stored in the specified folder with their names as mangachapter-pageno.jpg [700-20.jpg].

The code contains options to download one specific chapter if you need to.

Feel free to edit the code as you wish, and do share ideas to make it better!
